每个星期，大家有一个选票。 
他们不可以给选票他自己的主意。

	Goals:
There is an ordinary WeChat group where people can chat about music and mashups. From the start to the end of each week, they can vote on what mashup they are most excited about. They can submit up to one new idea each week. They can submit the idea at any time during the week. Once they have submitted, they cannot submit again until the next week. They can vote up to once each week. Once they have voted, they cannot vote again until the next week. They are never allowed to vote for their own idea. The new week starts and ends on Monday morning.

My job is to take the most popular suggestion and create the mashup for everyone. I will have one week to work on the mashup. 

	Process:
Because each person can only vote once before the system resets, we need a way to login each person. We can read their WeChat name or phone number using the WeChat API.
